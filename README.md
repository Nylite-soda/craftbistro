## The Story Behind SodaDine

This project was born from a desire to help a local restaurant in West Jefferson, NC, establish a strong online presence. I had a vision for a beautiful and functional website that would reflect the quality of their establishment. I developed the initial version of this application with that specific restaurant in mind.

Unfortunately, my attempt to pitch the idea was cut short. A brief phone call with the owner ended with a polite but firm, "Hey look, whatever it is you're selling, I'm not buying. Bye!" before I could even present my work.

Rather than letting the project go to waste, I decided to repurpose it into a template that any fine dining establishment could use. I've named it "SodaDine" as a placeholder, and it's now a testament to turning a moment of rejection into a creative opportunity.

This project is a showcase of what a modern restaurant website can be, and it's available for anyone to use and adapt for their own needs.
